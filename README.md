Welcome to this repository

This is a simple Python script that uses the psutil library to check available space on the hard disk. 
There is a set threshold witht he idea being that you get an alert every time your disk space exceeds a certain 'level'.

This script is part of a larger project that involves setting up cron jobs on a cloud service, setting up slack workspace and creating a webhook so that I can integrate slack alerts in the monitor script.
